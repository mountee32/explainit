What message, emotion, or idea was the artist trying to convey? It's possible that you could infer some of that from the work itself, but ultimately, you would need to ask the artist or study their other works to gain a deeper understanding of their intention.

This might involve sharing the core message of the gospel, such as the idea that all humans are sinners in need of salvation, and that God has provided a way for us to be reconciled to him through faith in Jesus Christ. The Christian can also explain some of the specific teachings of Jesus that they find particularly compelling, and invite the non-Christian to consider these ideas further.------4. Respond to objections: The non-Christian may raise objections or questions, which the Christian can respond to in a respectful and thoughtful manner. This might involve providing further explanation, offering counterarguments, or simply listening and asking clarifying questions. By engaging in a respectful dialogue, the Christian can help to build trust and create a more receptive environment for the message of the gospel.------5. Extend an invitation: Finally, the Christian can extend an invitation to the non-Christian, offering to continue the conversation or inviting them to attend a church service, Bible study, or other relevant event. By showing genuine interest in the non-Christian's spiritual journey and being willing to walk alongside them, the Christian can help to build a relationship of trust and ultimately create opportunities for the gospel to take root in the person's heart.","https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/spiritual-life/the-teachings-of-jesus-an-essential-part-of-your-spiritual-journey.html"
"New Age believer","How do you see the similarities and differences between New Age beliefs and Christianity?","One way to follow up and further the conversation with the goal of sharing the gospel would be to focus on the major differences between New Age beliefs and Christianity. Some major differences could include the source of authority (New Age beliefs tend to rely on self-discovery and personal experience while Christianity looks to the authoritative word of God), the nature of reality (New Age beliefs tend to emphasize a pantheistic or monistic worldview while Christianity believes in a personal God who created the world), and the concept of salvation (New Age beliefs tend to focus on personal growth and self-realization while Christianity emphasizes the need for a Savior and redemption through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ). ------From there, the conversation could delve deeper into the uniqueness of Christ and the message of the gospel. It could be helpful to share personal stories or testimonies of how one came to believe in Christ and how the gospel has impacted their life. Finally, it's important to invite the non-Christian to consider the claims of Christianity and the importance of making a decision about their own spiritual beliefs. ------Ultimately, the goal of sharing the gospel should be done with genuine love and respect for the other person, recognizing that God is the one who ultimately draws hearts to himself.","https://www.gotquestions.org/New-Age-Christianity.html"
"New Age believer","What are your views on the idea of objective truth?","One approach you could take is to share your personal experience of how the gospel has impacted your life. You could share how it has brought hope and purpose to your life, and how it has helped you navigate challenging situations. From there, you could ask the non-Christian if they have ever had any experiences that have given them a sense of meaning or purpose.------You could also ask them if they have any questions or concerns about Christianity, and address those with kindness and respect. It's important to listen actively to their responses and engage with them in an open and honest dialogue.------You could also share some of the basic tenets of Christianity, like the belief in a loving God who created the universe and desires a relationship with us, the reality of sin and its consequences, and the message of salvation through Jesus Christ.------Ultimately, the goal should be to establish a relationship of trust and respect with the non-Christian, and to share the gospel in a way that is clear, compassionate, and compelling. Remember that our job is not to convince or coerce people into believing, but to share the truth in love and trust that God will work in their hearts as he sees fit.","https://www.integratedcatholiclife.org/2017/04/trasancos-objective-truth/"
"LGBTQ+ individual","How has your experience as an LGBTQ+ individual influenced your views on spirituality or religion?","I would first try to understand the non-Christian's current belief system and any objections they may have towards Christianity. I would then address these objections and provide evidence for the existence of God and the reliability of the Bible as a source of truth. I would also share my personal testimony of how my relationship with Christ has positively impacted my life.------Next, I would explain the Gospel message; that all humans have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, but God loved us so much that He sent His only son, Jesus, to die on the cross and take the punishment that we deserved. By accepting Jesus as our savior and repenting of our sins, we can have eternal life and a restored relationship with God.------I would also address any questions the non-Christian may have regarding the afterlife or the concept of salvation. Finally, I would encourage the person to pray and seek a personal relationship with God for themselves.","https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lives-and-experiences-of-lgbtq-people-of-faith"
"LGBTQ+ individual","Have you ever explored the teachings of Jesus and how they might relate to your life?","One approach to follow up on the initial question is to ask the non-Christian if they have any thoughts on the person of Jesus or why he is such a significant figure in history. This can open the door to discussing the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and why these events are central to the Christian faith.------Another approach is to share personal experiences that have led you to embrace the Christian faith. This could include sharing how faith has helped you to overcome challenges or afflictions, or how you have experienced the love and grace of God in your life.------It is also crucial to listen attentively to the non-Christian's perspective, questions, and objections without being dismissive or judgmental. You can respectfully ask them to elaborate on their thoughts and feelings and seek to understand their worldview.------Finally, always be open to following up with further dialogue, resources or further questions that might arise over time. This approach will help build trust, understanding and a sense of shared learning in the process of sharing the gospel.","https://www.biblestudytools.com/topical-verses/jesus-teachings/"
